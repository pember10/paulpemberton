# Paul Pemberton
Welcome! I’m glad you’re here. I’m a hybrid Senior Software Engineer, meaning I have dual IC and People Manager roles. I am an MCSD in web platforms, and have skills in C#, React, TypeScript, Azure, ASP (.Net and Core), web services, APIs, and much more. I also have a passion for people, and love to help other developers grow in their skills and careers.

## Backend, Frontend, Full Stack. Oh My!
While my title is Senior Software Engineer, I am competent in the entire web stack. From deep business logic all the way up to the presentation layer, and everything in between, I can handle it.
- **Languages & Frameworks**: C#, Java, .NET Core, React, TypeScript, SCSS, Razor, etc.
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio Pro, GitHub Copilot, IntelliJ IDEA, Azure, GitHub, Jira, SQL Server.
- **Methodologies**: Agile and Scrum SDLCs.

## I Dabble In Everything

Even in my downtime, I’m still coding. I love to learn new ways of doing things, or learn new technologies. Here are a couple of projects I’m currently working on:
- **Thaumcraft 4 Reboot**: A re-write of the popular (and my favorite) Minecraft mod Thaumcraft 4.
- **Phylogenesis**: A horticultural database that allows you to search for plants based on their scientific names, common names, or other characteristics.

## About Me
Schweitzer once said, “Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.”

### Mind for Coding
I’m a Senior Software Engineer. I love coding, people, and discovery. I crave autonomy and mastery, and I love to help others grow in their skills and careers. For fun, I code game mods, websites, apps, or just tinker with something new.

### Work With My Hands
I am a carpenter at heart. Most of the furniture in my house I built myself. I have a passion for DIY, and I love to build things. Right now, I’m rebuilding a 1980 Ford F-250. It was my great grandpa’s truck, my grandpa’s truck, and now it’s mine. It has a lot of sentimental history.

### Family is My World
Family is the single most important thing to me. I have a wife and three children. When we’re not watching Chopped together, we’re fishing, camping, playing video games, or going on an adventure.
